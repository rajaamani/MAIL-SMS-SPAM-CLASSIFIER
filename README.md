# MAIL-SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFIER

This project is an end-to-end spam classifier for both SMS and email messages. It utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVC) model to classify incoming messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The classification process is wrapped in a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit and deployed on Heroku.
